### For Bhaumik's Work

For bar graph, I have implemented animation/transition on page load. Please reload page if graph does not display correctly on first load (rarely). I have used shades of blue for visually pleasing graph and for interaction, we have a mouseover/hover on each bar, displaying that show's image, title and rating.

For donut graph, I have implemented animation/transition on page load. Please reload page if graph does not display correctly on first load (rarely). I have used a set of color predefined from D3 for visually pleasing graph and for interaction, we have a mouseover/hover on each bar, highlighting that particular area. Additionally, on mouse click on any area of donut, you will see images of all shows in that genre and will dissapear on clicking out of area.
